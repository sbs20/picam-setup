# picam-setup.sh

Automates some of the duller aspects of installing the brilliant
[picam](https://github.com/iizukanao/picam) and automates the download of
binaries, making a decision based on your OS (jessie / stretch).

**This has only been lightly tested. Feedback and issues welcome**

The script installs picam in the current user's home directory.

## Run
Here's a one liner to install
```
wget -O picam-setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbs20/picam-setup/master/picam-setup.sh && chmod +x picam-setup.sh && ./picam-setup.sh install
```
